Linux / MacOS

git clone https://github.com/LeslyKinzel/Blackout-Neovim ~/.config/nvim/
```

```
git clone https://github.com/LeslyKinzel/Blackout-Neovim ~\AppData\Local\nvim\

*I don't use Windows anymore, so have not tested in a while.

Its probably better to use WSL and just edit your Windows file system via `/mnt/C/Users/your_name/`
